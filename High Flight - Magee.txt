High Flight

"Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth
     1      2           3     4        5
And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;
    1          2        3        4        5
Sunward I’ve climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth
1            2            3          4        5
of sun-split clouds, — and done a hundred things
   1         2             3      4       5
You have not dreamed of – wheeled and soared and swung
1           2      3        4        5
High in the sunlit silence. Hov’ring there,
1           2      3        4        5
I’ve chased the shouting wind along, and flung
     1          2        3     4         5
My eager craft through footless halls of air....
   1     2             3        4        5

Up, up the long, delirious, burning blue
    1      2       3        4       5
I’ve topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace.
     1          2          3            4    5
Where never lark, or even eagle flew —
      1     2        3    4     5
And, while with silent, lifting mind I've trod
     1          2       3       4         5
The high untrespassed sanctity of space,
    1      2          3     4     5
– Put out my hand, and touched the face of God."
