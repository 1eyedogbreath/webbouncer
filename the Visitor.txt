[Verse 1]
       C              D7          G       G7

   G                   D7      G        G7
He thinks she’s playin hard to get

        C               D7        G       G7
And the next chirp will bring her hoppin’

[Verse 3]
          C          D7       Em
But she’s twenty one floors below

Where the people do their shoppin’

       Bm                   Em
Out of sight and out of his mind

[Bridge]
       C        D7          Bm       Em
It’s a bit of a shame and a bit of a sin 
       1        3           5        7          ZZZ         LL 24

Neither one of us knows what a scrape we’re in
